awesome understanding! please meticulously review the attached PRD and UI/UX design guideline, then do a thoughtful relevant research to validate your assumptions. Then meticulously plan and create a comprehensive assessment on the proposed application blueprint.

Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach! Yes, please meticulously plan and create a machine-actionable token pipeline (JSON → CSS variables + TypeScript) and Storybook setup (Phase A deliverable).

---

awesome understanding! please meticulously review the attached PRD, its appendix and UI/UX design guideline, then do a thoughtful relevant research to validate your assumptions. Then meticulously plan and create a comprehensive assessment on the proposed application blueprint. I will share the relevant documents over this and the next prompt, so reserve your final assessment after I told you I have shared all the necessary documents for your complete evaluation, analysis and synthesis.

Yes, I have shared all the necessary documents. The third document is itself suggested additions/improvements to the original PRD shared. You may think deeper and think harder to deeply explore thoroughly and systematically to review, research and critique the design in a practical and implementable way. For example, how similar application should be designed and implemented.

Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach! Yes, please meticulously think/analyze, plan and then create a comprehensive and actionable `Project_Architecture_Document.md` with all the necessary mission/vision descriptions, project file hierarchy diagram with listing of key files and their descriptions, detailed mermaid diagram of the application logic flow, also mermaid diagram of user and application modules interaction. It should serve as a comprehensive single source-of-truth for a development to completely and unambiguously understand what the project is all about and how he should structure and build the envisioned codebase to realize the WHAT, WHY and HOW of the project. This is a very important and critical task for you as my technical advisor and partner, so take it with utmost care and due diligence. Please think deeply and think carefully to plan first before creating the comprehensive and complete PAD.

Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach! Based on your latest understanding of the WHAT, WHY and HOW of the project and the updated envisioning of the codebase, please meticulously plan and create a comprehensive and updated replacement file for `Project_Requirements_Document.md`, make the updated PRD a complete, well-thought-out and comprehensive replacement version with no placeholder comments. Please use the `Canvas` mode to edit/produce. 

---

Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning! Please meticulously plan and then create an awesome `README.md` for the GitHub repo to host your improved project. Please make the `README.md` informative and useful, with enough details to educate, inform and attract new contributors to the project. This is an important and critical task, so please think carefully and thoroughly to re-imagine the document's structure, layout and content first before you create an implementation plan for it.

---

awesome job on your meticulous analysis, planning and execution! please keep up the good work! now, please think deeper and think harder to meticulously explore how best to create a complete `Master_Execution_Plan.md` for AI coding agent to follow to build the complete codebase phase by phase. Break down the codebase completion master plan into logical phases which can be executed independently by a coding agent with minimal supervision. Specify the list of files to create for each phase, and for each file, describe its purpose and its interface, and include a checklist for each file. Each file will be validated against its checklist after generation. After think through a well-thought-out project codebase completion master plan, meticulously plan and then create it. review and validate the  `Master_Execution_Plan.md` after generation.


---

awesome meticulous job so far! please meticulously plan and then create a complete database schema SQL script which will serve as a complete representation the PostgreSQL v16 based database. The complete SQL script should be self sufficient to initialize my local dev database to support the envisioned codebase.
